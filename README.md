# shortcut-keyboard
A little keybord with ATmega32U4.

## Hardware
Microcontrollers like ATmega32U4 are able to act as a keyboard. Therefore the project uses an "arduino pro micro" which is compatible to arduino leonard.

Buttons are connected to GND and pins 7,8 and 9.


## Software
The project uses a sketchboard in the Arduino IDE.

Since the board is no official arduino, the board setting should be set to Arduino Leonardo.
